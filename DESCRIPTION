Description: Improved summary() methods for Bayesian statistical models with 
    categorical variables with more than two factor levels that interact with 
    other variables. Instead of the values of the coefficients 
    (which cannot be interpreted in such cases), output is given per factor 
    level and represent difference from intercept (i.e., unweighted grand mean).  
    In addition, appropriate contrasts that have the same marginal effects on 
    all factor levels are used per default.
